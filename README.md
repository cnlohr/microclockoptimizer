# Micro Clock Optimizer

A solver for helping setup clock trees for microcontrollers. You can see the demo online [here](https://cnlohr.github.io/microclockoptimizer/).

You can select different parameters to solve for, and it will compute all possible clock trees given the constraints (within limits) so it can quickly search the space.

Right now I just wrote a clock tree setup for the ch32v307. But it's ripe for the picking to get more setup.

This project is still in its infancy, but PR's are open!
